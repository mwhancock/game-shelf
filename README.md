# Game Shelf


## Description
Game Shelf is an application built using HTML, CSS, and javascript whose purpose is to help users manage their board game collection.
In it's current state, users can enter their Board Game Atlas username to import their game library from there, users can search for games, and it showcases some popular games on the home page.
I'm pulling all the game data from [Board Game Atlas' API](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs "BGA API docs").
I have a lot of cool things planned for this application, so be sure to check out the planned features section to find out more!

## Motivation
I came up with this project idea because tabletop gaming is a huge hobby of mine, and while there are some excellent apps to track your collection, none of them have all the features that I'd like to see. My goal is to create a fully featured desktop application and, further down the line, mobile applicatons for anroid and ios.

## Planned Features
There are many exciting features I plan to build in to the software!
Some highlights are:

* The ability to add games to your library
* Sync your library with BGG
* Organize library into different lists (owned, wishlist, for trade, etc...)
* Track game plays
* Game ratings
* Personalized game reccomendations based on game ranks and play counts
* Build in social features such as forums, chats, game groups
* Store front to purchase games directly from Game Shelf

## Getting Started
You can view Game Shelf in its current state [here](https://mwhancock.github.io/game-shelf "Game Shelf"). The first time you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a Board Game Atlas username. If you have one you can enter it to import your library. Otherwise leave this field blank to load a demo library.

If you want to play around wih the code, feel free to clone it onto your local system!
